# Winforms-map-getting-started
The [WinForms Map control](https://www.syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-controls/map?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=winforms-maps-github-samples) is a powerful data visualization component that displays statistical information for a geographical area. It has highly interactive and customizable features such as zooming, panning, selecting, markers, bubbles, and color mapping. Using the Map control, you can render various types of maps, such as sales, political-boundary, weather, electoral, and route.

## Features and benefits

### Shape layers
Render geographical shapes or custom shapes in the WinForms Map.


## Data
Bind shapefiles (.shp) and GeoJSON (.json) data to maps to render any geometric shape.

## Customization
Customize the default style of a shape using the color, stroke, and thickness properties.

## Custom shapes
Render any custom shape to represent building infrastructure, a sports stadium, plane or bus seat arrangements, and more.

## Sublayer
Load multiple shape files in a single map view. For example, add a sublayer over a main shape layer to view geographic features such as rivers, valleys, and cities.

### Data labels
Easily annotate WinForms Map shapes with labels to improve the readability of a particular shape's name. Customize the look and feel of default labels using font style, size, and color properties.

### Heat map
Produce a heat map by [customizing shape colors](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/map/map-shape-customization?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=winforms-maps-github-samples)) based on the underlying shape value.

## Equal color mapping
Equal [color mapping](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/map/customizing-map-appearance?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=winforms-maps-github-samples) differentiates a shape's fill color based on its underlying value and color. For example, apply colors to states based on their winning political candidates.

## Range color mapping
Apply colors to shapes by comparing their values with specified numeric ranges. For example, apply colors to states based on their population density.

### Map annotations
[Map annotations](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/map/annotations?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=winforms-maps-github-samples) allow you to denote a place with symbols, like pins, or display a message at specific coordinates on a map.

## Annotation types
You can draw shapes like circles, diamonds, rectangles, and squares to highlight a place. 

## Custom map annotations
Customize map annotation by adding images or any custom shape to highlight a location.

### Map bubbles
[Bubbles](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/map/bubbles?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=winforms-maps-github-samples) are used to add information to shapes, such as population density or land area. They are rendered with various magnitudes and colors based on the underlying data values of the shapes.

## Color customization
Customize the default color of a bubble and its transparency using the fill and opacity properties.

## Size customization
Customize the minimum and maximum size of a bubble to enhance its readability.

### User interactions
Interactive features, such as selecting, zooming, and panning, greatly enhance user experience.

## Selection
Select or highlight an area or shape to center the view over that area on a map.

## Zooming and panning
Zooming allows users to get a closer look at a particular area, and panning allows users to move a map around to focus on different areas.

## Tooltips
Tooltips display a pop-up with additional information about shapes, markers, and bubbles when the end user taps map elements.
